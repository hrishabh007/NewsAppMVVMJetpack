        "<p>Google has officially named the next version of Android, which is due to be released this fall: Android 10. Breaking the 10-year history of naming releases after desserts, the company is bailing on providing a codename beginning with a subsequent letter of the alphabet (in this case, Q), which is the way we&rsquo;ve been referring to Android up to now. This year is Android 10, next year will be Android 11, and so on.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After a quarter of quiet, the quintessence of Android&rsquo;s brand has quickly changed without quarrel, resolving a quandary and quitting the quixotic quest to pull a Q dessert out of the quiver. Google won&rsquo;t quaver on the decision to move away from desserts, which answers a quadrillion querulous questions about the names. Google has decided it is a quaint tradition that needed to be quite quashed &mdash; or at least quelled. Instead, the codename will be quarantined inside Google, so I have qualms and feel queasy about the quantity of quips that will queue up quoting the Android source code in an attempt to quibble that the dessert names still qualify as real. It all seems like a quagmire, but at least qualitatively, the new naming scheme is less quirky.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alongside the new name is an updated logo for Android, one that Aude Gandon, global brand director for Android, says has a &ldquo;more modern&rdquo; wordmark. Importantly, it will always include the little green robot. &ldquo;The robot is what makes Android special. It makes it human, fun, and approachable,&rdquo; Gandon says.</p>"
